# Sound-Classification module.
This module is used for processing raw waveform files to predict a positive or negative emotional state of the speaker.

## Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
The model used for this task is called M11 which is part of a Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks desgined to process raw waveform files.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train the model is IEMOCAP which consists of audio, video, and text.
